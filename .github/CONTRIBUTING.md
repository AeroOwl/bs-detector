# CONTRIBUTOR GUIDELINES

We welcome pull requests and community collaboration. Before contributing, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/selfagency/bs-detector/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You can chat with other community members in realtime on Gitter [here](https://gitter.im/bs-detector/).

Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/selfagency/bs-detector/projects) to see what we intend to integrate in future releases and to decide whether you'd like to help with one of those tasks, as they might be duplicative of new functionality you wish to propose. We don't want to squander your time or enthusiasm, so we recommend proposing new functionality in an issue or on Gitter before building something out we might not end up using. It will also provide you with an opportunity to hear from other community members who might help flesh out your ideas.

If you are planning to contribute, please work off and submit pull requests to the `dev` branch, which is the most current build. `master` is intended for public releases only and is usually several commits behind `dev`. Edit resources in `ext` and use `gulp build` to compile manually. Use `gulp watch` to compile automatically on file changes. The compiled, unpackaged extension will be in the `build` folder.
